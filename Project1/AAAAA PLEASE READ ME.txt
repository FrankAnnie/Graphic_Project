BIG SORRY FOR NOT DOING THE INSTRUCTION IN THE GAME.(NEED MORE TIME TO PREPARE EXAM...)

Should be a real light, a transparent light is on the tower(maybe not easy to see),I tried to set the color matrial of
the light but failed.Could you please check the code on line 808 in class Mainwindow,when i use color matrial its implement to
all of the objects and i don't know why. 
If you know the reason,could you please send me an email(387768428@qq.com). Thank you very much!!
